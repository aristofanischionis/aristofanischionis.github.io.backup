about_content: |
    Hi üëãüèª! Welcome to my website, my name is Aristofanis, I come from Athens, Greece, and currently live in Copenhagen, Denmark!
    
    I am a Cyber Security Engineer with a focus on Red Teaming and Penetration Testing. 
    I have been working as a <mark>Red Team Operator</mark> at Danske Bank, where I gained valuable experience performing adversary simulation, 
    vulnerability assessments, and exploitation of various systems such as web applications, databases, servers, printers, and other devices and services. 

    Before getting into Cyber Security, I gained my BSc in Computer Science and worked in several EU companies as a Web Developer.

          The Practical Network Penetration Tester [PNPT](https://certified.tcm-sec.com/b7f3a1bd-9727-4c40-8d4e-6abdafff0dd7){:target="_blank"} certification exam assesses a student's ability to perform a network penetration test at a professional level. 
          The student must perform Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather intel on how to properly attack the network. 
          Once inside, the student must leverage their Active Directory exploitation skillsets to compromise the exam domain controller. 
          After a successful compromise, the student must provide a detailed written report and perform a live debrief in front of our assessors to receive a passing score and certification.

          I had the privilege to present [Honeyscanner at BlackHat Europe 2023](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-23/arsenal/schedule/index.html#honeyscanner-a-vulnerability-analyzer-for-honeypots-35048){:target="_blank"}. 
          The event took place on the 6th of December 2023 in London, UK.
          [BlackHat](https://www.blackhat.com/about.html){:target="_blank"} is a computer security conference that provides security consulting, training, and briefings to hackers, corporations, and government agencies around the world.
          It is a very well-known and established event that gathers the best hackers from around the world and having the opportunity to be among them was a phenomenal experience.

          Designed and Developed Honeyscanner as part of my participation in [Google Summer of Code 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/6oyTxlUo){:target="_blank"}.
          Honeyscanner is a vulnerability analyzer for Honeypots. Its purpose is to automatically assess the security posture of specific open-source honeypot projects. 
          It does this by performing a series of `passive attacks` - including static code analysis and container scanning, and consecutively it executes a series of `active attacks` against a given honeypot instance.
          In the end, it provides the tester with a comprehensive security report.
